# Professional History

## Head of Engineering at Trust Fractal – May 2019 to May 2020
**Oversaw a team (7 engineers)** on non-technical management duties. Redesigned the whole engineering workflow by **implementing Kanban across Product and Development** and isolating interruptions into their own flow. This lead developers to not feel like ticket-takers, to not be distracted by day-to-day needs, and product managers to feeling part of a predictable delivery cadence.

Designed and oversaw the implementation of a cross-microservice data system that **empowered everyone to build custom real-time reports** using PostgreSQL's **postgres_fdw**, while safeguarding user data by enforcing column-level security labeling. Implemented some features to cover spot engineering needs, and was **regularly consulted for infra**. Routinely automated recurring engineering problems (reports for vendors and partners, palliative measures, continuous deployment, etc).

Fielded **security** needs. Answered compliance questionnaires, produced security description documents, coordinated incident response procedures with vendors, checked in during design time and code review to spot problems early and spread awareness. Designed and implemented a cold storage system for crypto-asset stewardship.

Was part of the company's management board. Used my position to **reach out to unengaged or distressed employees** to offer emotional support and mentoring. Finding myself being less participative, stepped down to give way to leaner and more focused top management.

## Technical Project Manager at Fractal Launchpad – May 2018 to April 2019
Responsible for the **technical delivery of multiple crypto fundraising events**, with up to 4 concurrent deliveries. Lifecycle went through kickoff, custom feature negotiation and implementation, **security coordination**, deployment, and operation. These events had a high security profile (**moving thousands of dollars and sensitive PII like passports**), very uncertain traffic (**anything from 0.1 to 100 req/s**), and unmoveable deadlines.

**Oversaw a small team (2 engineers + 1 project manager)**. Participated in custom feature development and lead a redesign effort (**React**/**Redux**, **Rails**, **PostgreSQL**). Sourced, coordinated with, and integrated work from contractors to suppress spurious labor needs.

Migrated infra setup from AWS Elastic Beanstalk to **ECS**, which **enabled a microservices architecture**. Reformulated all networking, logging, and alarms.

Actively participated in the parent company's management board, helping to **set direction and strategy** for both companies.

## Managing Partner at Life on Mars – September 2016 to May 2018
Looking to explore a different way of doing engineering management, **I co-founded a company** focused on maximizing happiness, openness, and skill. We built a high-talent **small software agency (of 6 engineers and 1 admin)** with some peripheral investments in product development.

**I was the only engineering manager**, so I defined and executed all relevant concerns (hiring, 1:1s, training,  process definition, etc) and provided support on most admin duties (finances, legal, processes, office, etc).

I also did some infra and app development work. A representative sample would be:
* Built multiple **React**/**Redux** frontends and respective **Rails** or **Phoenix** backends
* Oversaw and helped designing and building a trading card game with **React Native** and **Phoenix**
* Designed and built a **WordPress plugin** to sync entries from a no-code tool to blog posts
* Built **Rails** app for ALS patient prognosis, with **HIPPA-compliant infra**, codified using **terraform** and **Saltstack**
* **Incident support**: some clients called us saying "this website is on fire, can you join this call and help us fix it?"
* Investigated and proposed **fixes for backend performance bottlenecks**
* Built a baccarat game using **Ethereum** and state channels, with a web frontend

In early 2018, Fractal became our biggest client and invited us to be **acquihired**, which we accepted.

## Software Engineer at Yelp – October 2013 to July 2016
Full-stack development of features targeted at Yelp's business owners across the full breadth of a diverse technology stack (custom **JavaScript** framework, monolithic **Python** app, multiple **microservices**, **Mesos**, **MySQL**, **Kafka**, many **AWS** services, etc). Contributed to modernizing legacy infrastructure, performance, logging, monitoring, and automated error recovery.

**Lead a small team (3 people)** that designed and implemented Yelp Preview, a sales tool that lets you preview how a specific business owner's back-office will look, used by 80% of sales reps, powering thousands of sales pitches per day. Due to its architectural planning, **it required only a few tens of engineering hours in maintenance** since its introduction.

Worked on re-hauling the business owner activity feed microservice, migrating from Gearman to Kafka, and modernizing its clustering infra. **Helped trailblaze the introduction of Kafka company-wide**. Shaped and implemented tools and packages that became standard company practice.

Worked on the Yelp Platform, an online ordering brokerage system. Implemented monitoring on our partners' iframe performance, improved on-call tools and procedures, and established cross-system error monitoring. The conjunction of these **made diagnostics near-instantaneous, drastically cutting on-call stress and errors**, and recovering hundreds of orders.

**Spontaneously took ownership of legacy systems' issues**, with interventions including subsystem re-writes that spanned several quarters. Contributed many improvements to cross-organizational infrastructure and release tools, from a 90% reduction of dropped connections during some microservice deployments to building a tool to fully automate test failures triage (going from a painful 5 minutes of ticket hunting to 1 CLI call for the whole run).
