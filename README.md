# Professional History

## Head of Engineering at Trust Fractal - May 2019 to May 2020

TODO: fill me in.

## Technical Project Manager/CTO at Fractal Launchpad - May 2018 to April 2019

TODO: fill me in.

## Managing Partner at Life on Mars - September 2016 to May 2018
Looking to explore a different way of doing engineering management, **I've co-founded a company** with the goal of maximizing hapiness, openness, and skill. We built a high-talent **small software agency (of 6 engineers and 1 admin)** with some peripheral investments in product development.

**I was the only engineering manager**, so I defined and executed on all relevant concerns (hiring, performance reviews, career progression, 1:1s, training,  process definition, role and team struturing, etc) and provided support on most admin duties (finances, legal, processes, office, etc).

I also did some infra and app development work. A representative sample woud be:
* Built multiple **React**/**Redux** frontends and respective **Rails** or **Phoenix** backends
* Oversaw and helped designing and building a trading card game with **React Native** and **Phoenix**
* Designed and built a **WordPress plugin** to sync entries from an [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) table to blog posts
* Built **Rails** app that interfaced with R for ALS patient prognosis, with **HIPPA-compliant infra**, codified using **terraform** and **Saltstack**
* **Incident support**: some clients would call us saying "this website is on fire, can you join this call and help us fix it?"
* Investigate and propose **fixes for backend performance bottlenecks**
* Build a baccarat game using **Ethereum** and state channels, with a web frontend

By the start of 2018, Fractal became our best client and invited us to be **acquihired**, which we accepted.

## Software Engineer at Yelp – October 2013 to July 2016

Contributed to modernizing legacy infrastructure, performance, logging, monitoring, and automated error recovery.

**Lead a small team (3 people)** that designed and implemented Yelp Preview, a sales tool which lets you preview how a specific business owner's back-office will look like, used by 80% of sales reps, powering thousands of sales pitches per day. Due to its architectural planning, **it required only a few tens of engineering hours in maintenance** since its introduction.

Worked on re-hauling the business owner's activity feed microservice, migrating from Gearman to Kafka and modernizing its clustering infra. **Helped trail blaze the introduction of Kafka company-wide**. Shaped and implemented tools and packages that became standard practice.

Worked on Yelp Platform, an online ordering brokerage system. Implemented monitoring on our partners' iframe performance, improved on-call tools and procedures, and established cross-system error monitoring. The conjunction of these **made diagnostics near instantaneous, drastically cutting on-call stress and errors**, and recovering hundreds of orders.

**Spontaneously took ownership of legacy systems' issues**, with interventions ranging from error recovery to complete subsystem re-writes that spanned several quarters. Contributed several improvements to cross-organizational infrastructure and release tools, from small changes which resulted on a 90% reduction of dropped connections during microservice deployment to a tool for fully automated triage of test failures (going from a painful 5 minutes of ticket hunting per failure to 1 CLI call for the whole run).
