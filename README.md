# Professional History

## Head of Engineering at Trust Fractal – May 2019 to May 2020

TODO: fill me in.

## Technical Project Manager/CTO at Fractal Launchpad – May 2018 to April 2019
Responsible for the **technical delivery of multiple crypto fundraising events**, with up to 4 concurrent deliveries. Lifecycle went through kickoff, custom feature negotiation and implementation, **cross-company security coordination**, and deployment operation. These events had a high-security profile (**moving thousands of dollars and sensitive PII like passports**), very uncertain traffic (**anything from 0.1 to 100 req/s**), and unmoveable deadlines.

**Oversaw a small team (2 engineers + 1 project manager)**. Participated in product development (**React**/**Redux**, **Rails**, **PostgreSQL**). Sourced, coordinated with, and integrated work from contractors.

Migrated infra setup from AWS Elastic Beanstalk to ECS, which **enabled a microservices architecture**. Reformulated all networking, logging, and alarms.

## Managing Partner at Life on Mars – September 2016 to May 2018
Looking to explore a different way of doing engineering management, **I co-founded a company** focused on maximizing happiness, openness, and skill. We built a high-talent **small software agency (of 6 engineers and 1 admin)** with some peripheral investments in product development.

**I was the only engineering manager**, so I defined and executed all relevant concerns (hiring, 1:1s, training,  process definition, etc) and provided support on most admin duties (finances, legal, processes, office, etc).

I also did some infra and app development work. A representative sample would be:
* Built multiple **React**/**Redux** frontends and respective **Rails** or **Phoenix** backends
* Oversaw and helped designing and building a trading card game with **React Native** and **Phoenix**
* Designed and built a **WordPress plugin** to sync entries from a no-code tool to blog posts
* Built **Rails** app for ALS patient prognosis, with **HIPPA-compliant infra**, codified using **terraform** and **Saltstack**
* **Incident support**: some clients called us saying "this website is on fire, can you join this call and help us fix it?"
* Investigated and proposed **fixes for backend performance bottlenecks**
* Built a baccarat game using **Ethereum** and state channels, with a web frontend

In early 2018, Fractal became our biggest client and invited us to be **acquihired**, which we accepted.

## Software Engineer at Yelp – October 2013 to July 2016
Full-stack development of features targeted at Yelp's business owners across the full breadth of a diverse technology stack (custom **JavaScript** framework, monolithic **Python** app, multiple **microservices**, **Mesos**, **MySQL**, **Kafka**, many **AWS** services, etc). Contributed to modernizing legacy infrastructure, performance, logging, monitoring, and automated error recovery.

**Lead a small team (3 people)** that designed and implemented Yelp Preview, a sales tool that lets you preview how a specific business owner's back-office will look, used by 80% of sales reps, powering thousands of sales pitches per day. Due to its architectural planning, **it required only a few tens of engineering hours in maintenance** since its introduction.

Worked on re-hauling the business owner activity feed microservice, migrating from Gearman to Kafka, and modernizing its clustering infra. **Helped trailblaze the introduction of Kafka company-wide**. Shaped and implemented tools and packages that became standard company practice.

Worked on the Yelp Platform, an online ordering brokerage system. Implemented monitoring on our partners' iframe performance, improved on-call tools and procedures, and established cross-system error monitoring. The conjunction of these **made diagnostics near-instantaneous, drastically cutting on-call stress and errors**, and recovering hundreds of orders.

**Spontaneously took ownership of legacy systems' issues**, with interventions including subsystem re-writes that spanned several quarters. Contributed many improvements to cross-organizational infrastructure and release tools, from a 90% reduction of dropped connections during some microservice deployments to building a tool to fully automate test failures triage (going from a painful 5 minutes of ticket hunting to 1 CLI call for the whole run).

## Independent Software Contractor – January 2012 to July 2013
movercado.org: Designed and implemented an SMS-handling workflow system in **Rails** and **PostgreSQL**. Helped to bootstrap the team that continued the project.

opensoft.pt: Helped team getting up to speed with **Django**'s best practices and did some surgical backend work.

escolinhas.pt: Responsible for integrating two heterogeneous applications (**ASP.NET** and **Rails** through **RabbitMQ**) with tight knowledge coupling but loose structural and behavioral coupling, easily accommodating future integrations.
