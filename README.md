Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ This CV iteration has a prose-like approach. For the classic CV experience, **scan just the bold parts**.

# Professional History

## Head of Engineering at Trust Fractal â€“ May 2019 to May 2020
Had **managerial oversight over a team of 7 engineers**. Redesigned engineering's workflow by **implementing Kanban across Product and Development** and isolating interruptions into their own flow. This lead developers to not feel like ticket-takers, to not be distracted by day-to-day needs, and product managers started feeling a predictable delivery cadence.

Designed and oversaw the implementation of a cross-microservice data system that **empowered everyone to build custom real-time reports** using PostgreSQL's **postgres_fdw**, while safeguarding user data by enforcing column-level sensitivity labeling. Implemented some features to reinforce engineering capacity, and was **regularly consulted for infra**. Automated away some recurring engineering problems (reports for vendors and partners, palliative measures, etc).

Fielded **security** needs. Handled compliance, coordinated incident response procedures with vendors, checked in early in the lifecycle to spot problems and spread awareness. Designed and implemented a cold storage system for crypto-asset stewardship.

Was part of the company's top management. Used my position to **reach out to unengaged or distressed employees** to offer emotional support and mentoring. Finding myself being less participative, I stepped down to encourage a leaner and more focused team.

## Technical Project Manager at Fractal Launchpad â€“ May 2018 to April 2019
Responsible for the **technical delivery of multiple crypto fundraising events**, with up to 4 concurrent deliveries. Lifecycle went through kickoff, custom feature negotiation and implementation, **security coordination**, deployment, and operation. These events had a high security profile (**moving thousands of dollars and sensitive PII like passports**), very uncertain traffic (**anything from 0.1 to 100 req/s**), and unmoveable deadlines.

**Oversaw a small team (2 engineers + 1 project manager)**. Participated in custom feature development and lead a redesign effort (**React**/**Redux**, **Rails**, **PostgreSQL**). Sourced, coordinated with, and integrated work from contractors to suppress spurious labor needs.

Migrated infra setup from AWS Elastic Beanstalk to **ECS**, which **enabled a microservices architecture**. Reformulated all networking, logging, and alarms.

Actively participated in the parent company's top management, where I **helped set direction and strategy** for both companies.

## Managing Partner at Life on Mars â€“ September 2016 to May 2018
Looking to explore a different way of doing engineering management, **I co-founded a company** focused on maximizing happiness, openness, and skill. We built a high-talent **small software agency (of 6 engineers and 1 admin)** with some peripheral investments in product development.

My main role was **engineering manager** but also did infra and development work. A representative sample would be:
* Built multiple **React**/**Redux** frontends and respective **Rails** or **Phoenix** backends
* Designed and built a **WordPress plugin** to sync entries from a no-code tool to blog posts
* Built **Rails** app for ALS patient prognosis, with **HIPAA-compliant infra**, codified using **terraform** and **Saltstack**
* **Incident support**: some clients called us saying "this website is on fire, can you join this call and help us fix it?"
* Built a baccarat game using **Ethereum** and state channels, with a web frontend

In early 2018, Fractal became our biggest client and invited us to be **acquihired**, which we accepted.

## Software Engineer at Yelp â€“ October 2013 to July 2016
Full-stack development on Yelp's business owner's back-office across a diverse technology stack (custom **JavaScript** framework, monolithic **Python** app, multiple **microservices**, **Mesos**, **MySQL**, **Kafka**, many **AWS** services, etc). Contributed to modernizing infra, performance, logging, monitoring, and automated error recovery.

**Lead a small team (3 people)** that designed and implemented Yelp Preview, which let you preview a business owner's back-office, powering thousands of sales pitches per day. Due to its architectural planning, **it required only a few tens of engineering hours in maintenance** since its introduction.

**Helped trailblaze the introduction of Kafka company-wide**, migrating two microservices to use it. Helped shaped the packages that became company standard.

Worked on the Yelp Platform, an online ordering brokerage system. Implemented monitoring on our partners' iframe performance, improved on-call tools and procedures, and established cross-system error monitoring. These **made diagnostics near-instantaneous, drastically cutting on-call stress and errors**, and recovering hundreds of orders.

**Spontaneously took ownership of legacy systems' issues**, including subsystem re-writes that spanned several quarters. Many contributions to infra and release tools, from a 90% reduction in dropped connections during some deployments to test failure triage automation (going from 5 painful minutes of ticket hunting to 1 CLI call).
